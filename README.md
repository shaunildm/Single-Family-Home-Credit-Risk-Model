# Single-Family-Home-Credit-Risk-Model

Capstone Project
By Shaunil Maharaj


## Introduction

As part of a larger effort to increase transparency, Freddie Mac have made loan-level credit performance data on fully amortized fixed-rate mortgages that either company purchased or guaranteed from 1999 to 2018, available to all in an effort to boost transparency. This effort will allow investors to build accurate performance models in support of risk sharring initiatives by the Federal Housing Finance Agency(FIFA). With this data we will create a credit risk model that can predict loan defaults.


### Data

The dataset covers approximately 27.8 million fixed-rate mortgages (including HARP loans) originated between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2018. Monthly loan performance data, including credit performance information up to and including property disposition, is being disclosed through June 30, 2019. Specific credit performance information in the dataset includes voluntary prepayments and loans that were Foreclosure Alternatives and REOs. Specific actual loss data in the dataset includes net sales proceeds, MI recoveries, non-MI recoveries, expenses, current deferred UPB, and due date of last paid installment.

The primary dataset is divided into two text files for each acquisition quarter, starting in 2000. The “Acquisition” file
includes static mortgage loan data at the time of the mortgage loan’s origination and delivery to Fannie Mae. The
“Performance” file provides the monthly performance data of each mortgage loan since the time of Fannie Mae’s
acquisition up until its current status as of the previous quarter, until the mortgage loan has been liquidated (e.g., paidoff, repurchased, short sale, etc.), or in the event of a real estate owned (REO) property, until expenses and proceeds
have been collected following disposal of the property. In addition, certain data attributes will be updated to reflect
new terms, if applicable, as a result of a modification. The HARP dataset is organized in a similar manner, but also
includes a mapping key, which can be accessed by logging into our Single Family Loan Performance dataset, to
assist in aligning the loan ID at acquisition with the corresponding loan ID after refinancing.
Complete definitions of the data elements are in the glossary.
